- No null
- No getters and setters
- No mutable objects
- No static methods, not even private ones
- No instanceof, type casting or reflection
- No implementation inheritance

## What about logging?

The library uses [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch) for logging. As well you can enable logging of the [Apache HTTP 
client](https://hc.apache.org) library by specifying command line parameters 
(read [this](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html) for more details): 
```
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime=true
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.http=DEBUG
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.http.wire=ERROR
```
